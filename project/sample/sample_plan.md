1. **Page Structure:**
   - Create a basic HTML structure with a header, main section, and footer.
   - The main section should prominently display the product list.

2. **Styling:**
   - Use CSS for basic styling. Focus on grid layouts to display products in an organized manner.
   - Ensure the page is responsive to accommodate various device sizes.

3. **Product Data:**
   - Establish a JSON structure to represent each vegetable. Include details such as name, price, and image.
   - Fetch product data from a local JSON file initially for simplicity.

4. **Functionality:**
   - Implement JavaScript to dynamically render the product listings based on the JSON data.
   - Add functionality to sort and filter the product list based on criteria like price or name.

5. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure the page displays correctly across all major browsers and devices.
   - Validate the HTML and CSS with proper tools to ensure standards compliance.

This plan outlines the key steps to develop a product listing page focused on selling vegetables in an e-commerce setting.
